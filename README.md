# Ishill: a Theme for Hugo That Makes Zines: the Example Site

Ishill is a Hugo theme that lets you turn Markdown into impressed, double-side-printable, saddle-stiched (stapled in the middle) zines, while also still being a wey to publish the same content on the Web, for free.

This is the example site repository. Most Hugo themes have an example site that shows you how to use them, and Ishill is no different. This site is designed so that you can clone it, edit a few things, and start publishing immediately. It's also designed to build locally or directly on either of two free code hosting platforms, and deploy to any system that supports static website hosting. We currently have **four** example hosts to look at (the code's the same in every place):

* Example site hosted on [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/): <https://ussjoin.gitlab.io/ishill-examplesite/>
    * Example site repository on GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/ussjoin/ishill-examplesite>
* Example site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages): <https://ussjoin.github.io/ishill-examplesite/>
    * Example site repository on GitHub: <https://github.com/ussjoin/ishill-examplesite>
* Example site hosted on [Autistici/Inventati](https://www.autistici.org/): <https://www.autistici.org/ishill/>
* Example site hosted on [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/): <https://ishillexamplesite.nfshost.com/>

A bit more content for this README coming soon, but go look at the "Ishill Monograph" on any of the above sites to learn more about Ishill and how to use it.
